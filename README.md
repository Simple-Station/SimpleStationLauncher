# SS14.Launcher

This is the launcher you should be using to connect to SS14 servers. Server browser, content downloads, account management. It's got it all!

# Development

Useful environment variables for development:
- `SS14_LAUNCHER_DATADIR=SimpleStation14` to change the directory the launcher stores all data in. This can be useful to avoid breaking your "normal" SS14 launcher data while developing something.
- `SS14_LAUNCHER_APPDATA_NAME=launcher` to change the user data directories the launcher stores its data in. This can be useful to avoid breaking your "normal" SS14 launcher data while developing something.
